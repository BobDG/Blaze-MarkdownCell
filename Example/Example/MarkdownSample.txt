# An exhibit of Markdown

This note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.

*Note: Feel free to play with this page. It's a text file within the example project.*

## Basic formatting

Paragraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.

Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported.

## Lists

### Ordered list

1. Item 1
2. A second item
3. Number 3, let's try the second line indent as well by having a lot of text to force multiple lines

### Unordered list

* An item
* Another item
* Yet another item with multiple lines, should still indent correctly on the second line as well. It works as long as you don't set the text alignment!
* And there's more...


### Quote

> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.

## Headings

There are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.

### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**

Of course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.

I don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.

## URLs

URLs can be made in a handful of ways:

* A named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/) Looks good doesn't it! :)
* Sometimes you just want a link-URL fully written like http://www.markitdown.net/. Also possible!

## Images

Markdown can also contain images. I'll need to fix this sometime in the future.

## Finally

There's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.
